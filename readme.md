# PyCaret Streamlit Project

This repository contains a Python project that leverages PyCaret and Streamlit to automate machine learning workflows and create a user-friendly web application for data exploration and model deployment.

## Project Overview

The PyCaret Streamlit Project aims to simplify the process of building and deploying machine learning models by integrating PyCaret's low-code machine learning library with Streamlit's interactive web app framework. The project consists of the following components:

1. **Machine Learning Package**: Contains scripts and modules for data preprocessing, model training, and model selection using PyCaret.
2. **Streamlit Web App**: A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload datasets, explore data visualizations, and deploy machine learning models.

## Features

- **Automated Machine Learning**: Utilize PyCaret's AutoML functionality to automatically select the best machine learning model for a given dataset.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Explore datasets through interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deploy models and visualize data using an intuitive web app interface built with Streamlit.
